# Train Scheduler

This app is used for scheduling train arrival times using jQuery, Moment.js, and a Firebase realtime database. This app is useful for anyone who would like to learn about timing strategies in Moment.js that update in a realtime database. 

Users can interact with the Train Scheduler by inputting their own train information: a creative train name, a destination, the train's first arrival time of the day or its upcoming arrival time, and the frequency at which the train runs ("The train runs every __ minutes"). The app will then use this information to calculate the train's next arrival time in realtime and the minutes remaining until that next arrival. The user will find the train schedule in the table in the middle of the page.
