# Train-Scheduler

This app is used for scheduling train arrival times using jQuery and Moment.js. This app is useful for anyone who would like to learn about solving timing issues that update in a realtime database. Users can interact with the Train Scheduler by inputting their own train name, its destination, its first arrival time of the day, and the frequency at which the train runs. The app will then take this information and calculate the train's next arrival time in real time and the minutes remaining until the next arrival. The user will find all the relevant data in the table in the middle of the page. This app is being updated by rwieberdink.
